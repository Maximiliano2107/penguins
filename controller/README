This section is designed to be built using arduino-cmake from:
https://github.com/queezythegreat/arduino-cmake#using-arduino-cmake

This has been added as a submodule to this project; you can get it by running:
git submodule update --init controller/arduino-cmake

from the root of your git clone.

You'll also need to install the Arduino SDK, cmake, and assorted development tools (gcc, avrdude). Follow
the instructions in the arduino-cmake readme for more info, but a quick primer is:

mkdir build
cd build 
cmake ..
make

To upload to your arduino, you'll need to update the PORT= line in CMakeLists.txt or pass a PORT= line
on the command line, like so:

make controller-upload PORT=/dev/ttyACM0

To build with support for the AGM sensor, this code requires the LSM303 and L3G4200D libraries from Pololu; be
sure to get them:

git submodule update --init controller/minIMU-9/LSM303
git submodule update --init controller/minIMU-9/L3G4200D
