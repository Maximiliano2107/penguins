This section is designed to be built using arduino-cmake from:
https://github.com/queezythegreat/arduino-cmake#using-arduino-cmake

You'll need to install the Arduino SDK, cmake, and assorted development tools (gcc, avrdude). Follow
the instructions in the arduino-cmake readme for more info, but a quick primer is:

mkdir build
cd build 
cmake ..
make

To upload to your arduino, you'll need to specify the serial port on the command line.
